-A Bezier curve
Provide 4 points for the curve and visualize an animation of a point moving from the first to the last point. Velocity and acceleration are also shown.

[1 Point does not make sense :-)]

-Animation of Stoke's first problem
Change slider to see evolution of the error function

-Stresses in beam bendind
"Scan the stresses inside a beam subjected to bending"!

-Stiffness of composite (homogenized) 
Changes if in parallel or in series. Also showing an intermediate line, trying to guess how particle-composites could work

-Many interpolations
All of them failing to interpolate 1/(1+25*x^2) in the screenshot (one of many functions that are tough to interpolate)

-Animation of compression using continuum mechanics
This one is pretty cool. Make sure you open it. If I recall, it is for isotropic materials and a particular Poisson ratio (most likely 0.5; so no volume change)

-Kutzbachplan
Some diagram used to visualize velocities in a planetary gearbox. You can adjust the dimensions of gears and their angular velocities. Also called Willis diagram???

-Type II error/Consumer risk/Beta risk/false negative
Very interesting idea! And I always forget which one is which (alpha and beta errors)
